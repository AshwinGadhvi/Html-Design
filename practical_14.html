        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vijay Vilas Palace is an impressive 450-acre palace estate at Mandvi where the Maharaos of Kutch spent summer in the 1940s. The imposing palace is built in an Indo-European style with exquisite stonework.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace estate is the privately-owned beach, which is a unique attraction. The erstwhile princely family now offer accommodation in a tented resort at the beach site. The resort has been designed to look like a royal guest camp keeping with the location in the palace estate, with each tented room featuring British colonial style wooden furniture, modern bathrooms and a patio. The thatched open-sided restaurant  on the beachside has an unending sea view and barbecues are arranged on the beach. Other beach facilities include a volleyball court, deck chairs and shady sitting arrangements. </p>
